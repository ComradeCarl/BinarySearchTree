This is a generic Binary Search Tree template I created for the implementation of data structures. It can be used universally to organize large sets of data without putting strain on memory as it uses recursion to insert and remove nodes from the search tree. I have used this for testing file handling many times in the past and it has worked very well. 

Ensure that the same directory contains the bnode.py when you use the BST.py file alongside with the files you will handle with in Python.
